# Info
Fishing script works on any 16:9, 16:10, or 4:3 resolution that's in the game's "Windowed" resolution list from 1280x720 to 2560x1440 (you can run one of those resolutions fullscreen as long as it is in the list for Windowed).

# Usage
1. Download `fishing.ahk` and all `E` png files to the same folder.
2. Right click `fishing.ahk` + 'Run as Administrator'.
3. Open Destiny 2, and bind Interact to E and remove any other Interact binds.
4. Select a supported resolution for the script in Video settings (see above).
5. Travel to Fishing Pond, begin fishing, then press `F11`.
6. Fish without needing to pay attention. You _should_ get movement inputs to prevent you from being sent to orbit.
