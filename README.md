AutoHotKey files to automate the donation of Destiny 2 Fractaline while redeeming Paradox bounties and dismantling weapons.

Steps:
1) Download https://www.autohotkey.com/
2) Download the new combined 1080p script. The new combined script is 1920x1080 specific.

---- Ensure you are running in Fullscreen or Windowed modes only.

---- Fullscreen Windowed will not work if your native resolution is > 1080p.

---- Ensure your screen bounds are default (maximum)

3) Once downloaded, double click on the script of your choice to activate the hotkeys. AutoHotKey does not have a GUI, it just "launches" and has a green "H" icon in the task bar by your clock.

Requirements for the full loop:
1) Empty your Kinetic inventory
2) Have 240,000+ glimmer
3) Have 4,400 Fractaline
4) Open Tower Obelisk, center your cursor on the middle of the Perfect Paradox bounty, hit F4
5) Don't move your mouse until the script it finishes (~12min)
6) Repeat / go get more glimmer from Spider and repeat.

New Hotkey Options:

F4 = Full loop of 12 cycles to utilize all 240k glimmer buying Perfect Paradox guns (MAXIMUM SHARDS)
F5 = 1 full Perfect Paradox cycle (buy up to 7 bounties, donate, redeem, dismantle)
F6 = 1 cycle without dismantling for Paradox god roll farming
F7 = Donate fractaline ONLY via loop (Toggle on and off with F7)
F8 = Alternate weapon farming. Edit the downloaded file with an editor (i.e. Notepad) and see the first comments to update XPosChange and YPosChange variables.
F9 = Full loop of 20 cycles to redeem 240k glimmer buying Trophy Hunter guns (MAXIMUM CORES)
F10 = 1 full cycle of core farming.
