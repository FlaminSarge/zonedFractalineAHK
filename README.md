AutoHotKey files to automate the donation of Destiny 2 Fractaline while redeeming Paradox bounties and dismantling weapons.

Steps:
1) Download https://www.autohotkey.com/
2) Download the combined 1080p script. The new combined script is 1920x1080 specific.

---- Ensure you are running in Fullscreen or Windowed modes only at 1920x1080.

---- Fullscreen Windowed will not work if your native resolution is > 1080p.

---- Ensure your screen bounds are default (maximum)

3) Once downloaded, double click on the script of your choice to activate the hotkeys. AutoHotKey does not have a GUI, it just "launches" and has a green "H" icon in the task bar by your clock.

Requirements for all options:
1) Open Tower Obelisk, center your cursor on the middle of the Perfect Paradox bounty, hit F4
2) Don't move your mouse until the script it finishes (~12min for the full Paradox loop)
3) Repeat / go get more glimmer from Spider and repeat.

New Hotkey Options:

-----------------

F4 = Full loop of 12 cycles to utilize all 240k glimmer buying/sharding Perfect Paradox guns (MAXIMUM SHARDS)

F5 = 1 full Perfect Paradox cycle (buy up to 7 bounties, donate, redeem, dismantle)

F6 = 1 cycle without dismantling for Paradox god roll farming

-----------------

F7 = Alternate weapon farming. Edit the downloaded file with an editor (i.e. Notepad) and see the first comments to update XPosChange and YPosChange variables.

-----------------

F8 = Full loop of 20 cycles to utilize 240k glimmer buying/sharding Trophy Hunter guns (MAXIMUM CORES)

F9 = 1 full cycle of core farming.

-----------------

F10 = Donate fractaline ONLY via loop (Toggle on and off with F10)

F11 = loop to buy materials / glimmer from Spider
