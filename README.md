AutoHotKey files to automate the donation of Destiny 2 Fractaline while redeeming Paradox bounties and dismantling weapons.

Steps:
1) Download https://www.autohotkey.com/
2) Download the combined 1080p script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonedguy/zoned/master/combined_fractaline_1920x1080_updated.ahk

		Ensure you are running in Fullscreen or Windowed modes only at 1920x1080.

		Fullscreen Windowed will not work if your native resolution is > 1080p.

		Ensure your screen bounds are default (maximum)

3) Once downloaded, double click on the script of your choice to activate the hotkeys. AutoHotKey does not have a GUI, it just "launches" and has a green "H" icon in the task bar by your clock.

Requirements for all options:
1) Ensure your primary weapon inventory is empty except your equipped weapon 
2) Open Tower Obelisk, center your cursor on the middle of the Perfect Paradox bounty, hit hotkey of your choice
3) Don't move your mouse until the script it finishes (~12min for the full Paradox loop)
4) Repeat / go get more glimmer from Spider and repeat.
